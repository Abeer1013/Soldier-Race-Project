# Soldier-Race-Project


A supervised machine-learning algorithm was created to predict the race of soldiers based on some features. The project was built with different supervised ML algorithms which are: Logistic regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and XG Boost algorithms. The model shows that the Logistic Regression algorithm performs better with imbalanced data than other algorithms.
